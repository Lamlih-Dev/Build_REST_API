# Build a REST API with Node JS and Express
It's been a while im listening the word REST API and always wondered what is it? What it's used for? <br>
Today i made a desition to start learning how it works and how to build one, this is my first REST API that i created with Node JS and Express
(Without MongoDB, i wanted to learn and know how it works in a simple way) which it's manage the users (Create - Read - Update - Delete). <br>
Building this REST API, i learned a lot of things such as :
<ul>
  <li>How to use Nodemon (To refresh automatically when changes occurred)</li>
  <li>How to use Node JS and Express</li>
  <li>How to use Express Routing</li>
  <li>Exploit all the requests (POST, GET, DELETE, PATCH)</li>
  <li>Difference between PUT and PATCH</li>
  <li>File management by separating the routes and the controllers from the index file</li>
  <li>How to send requests using POSTMAN</li>
</ul>
